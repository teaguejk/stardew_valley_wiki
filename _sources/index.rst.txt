:ref:`Getting Started <gettingstarted>`
========================================
You will first be tasked with creating your character and choosing your pet, pick whatever you want here,
it will not affect gameplay.


:ref:`Skills and Professions <skills>`
=======================================

Skills are the key to progress in Stardew Valley. Your character has five different skills that you can level up by doing different things in the game. Each skill has ten levels and 2 professions, at levels 5 and 10, you can choose between two professions. These professions will act as perks that will make the game easier. They can be changed later in the game, for a price. Leveling these skills is the best way to progress in the game because it gives you access to different craftable items that make the game easier.
